By default, this will output to the current terminal window.\n","\n","2. Some functions, like the **[print()](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/002_Python_Functions_Built_in/051_Python_print%28%29.ipynb)** function, are **[built-in functions](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/tree/main/002_Python_Functions_Built_in)** included in Python by default. These built-in functions are always available for us to use in programs that we create. We can also define **our own functions** that we construct ourselves through other elements.\n","\n","3. Inside the parentheses of the **`print()`** function is a sequence of characters — **Hello, World!** — that is enclosed in quotation marks **`'`** or **`\"`**. Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are called a **string**.\n","\n","4.
